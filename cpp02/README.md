#FIXED POINT NUMBERS

Fixed point numbers are another way of understanding decimal numbers
We are used to dealing with floats but these have some weird way of storing binary. They are not the fastest and surely not the easiest to understand, but have other great things.

Fixed point numbers are numbers that, as said by its name, have a fixed point in their value. 
To represent these kinnd of numbers we need two things, some kind of data to store the binary value (an integer for example, 4bytes) and a fixed point value, this value will tell us in which bit we place a point.
If you wanna see this in action go into te the /test/README.md

Fixed point values hold great advantages: They a flexible in precision and range (depending on where you place the point), they are flexible in data size, they deal with some operations faster (+-...)...
They obviously have some disadvantages but overall they are great
